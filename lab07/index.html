        <p>Hello, my name is Manny. My current major is Information Management Technology with a concentration in Cybersecurity. Concepts like network and cloud computing, as well as leveraging data and technology to reach an informed decision, interest me the most when it comes to IT.  My current skills as it pertains to IT are as follows: Basic comprehension in Python and Java, and fluency in Excel, Word, Microsoft Project, and other Microsoft Products.</p> 
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy the following:</p>
<ul> 
    <li>hiking and sports, most notably ice hockey</li>
    <li>I am also an equestrian, belonging to  Syracuse Universityâ€™s Western Team.</li>
</ul>  
<p><strong>I am originally from Miami, Florida, and due to the military, I have been in almost every state in the South, and I currently reside in the Northeast. </strong></p>
<p>By taking this stride into HTML, I hope to improve my critical thinking skills and ability to pick up yet another language!</p>
