    <h1>Inspirations and Takeaways</h1>
    
    <p>Different music invokes different feelings. This page highlights who inspired both bands and what their listener's take away from listening to them.</p>

    <h2>Gojira</h2>
    <p>Gojira, the French Metal Band we've taken a fair dive into, draws their inspirations from other metal and progressive bands like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sepultera</li>
        <li>Morbid Angel</li>
        <li>Death</li>
    </ul>

    <p>They also implement French philosophy mixed with Buddhist ideas and drown it into their music, painting their music sheet canvas with themes of environmentalism and spirituality.</p>

    <h3>What listeners take home:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A strong understanding of existential and environmental issues</li>
        <li>Spiritual reflection</li>
        <li>Philosophical Reflection</li>
        <li>Catharsis, through intensity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Big Thief</h2>
    <p>Big Thief, the indie-folk band we have discussed, draws their inspiration from artists including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bob Dylan</li>
        <li>Neil Young</li>
        <li>Joni Mitchell</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can clearly pick up the somber, yet brutal tones of Elliott Smith, and the subtle, yet crushing chord progressions of Sharon Van Etten.</p>

    <h3>What fans take away:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Intimacy and Connection</li>
        <li>Understanding of Emotions</li>
        <li>Understanding of Vulnerability</li>
        <li>Comfort and relatedness</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I certainly hope you enjoyed my deep dive on my two very drastically different bands. In my opinion, by listening to them you will gain a deeper appreciation for life, and what it means to appreciate every moment for what it is. Each band offers a different perspective, and what you choose to take out of the band as the listener is completely up to interpretation, but I definitely urge you to take a listen.</p>
